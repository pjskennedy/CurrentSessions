        On a cold, dark, march night in Toronto, two young independent film makers were staying up all night out of fear of missing their six am bus. In the early hours of the morning, after many pots of coffee, countless jam sessions and one trip to Mcdonalds, <b>Nicholas Posthumus</b> and <b>Marco Carboni</b> hatched a plan to make captivating, acoustic recording session videos that also raise awareness for fresh water conservation, and thus, Current Sessions Productions was born. Current Sessions Productions is a non-for-profit production company that features an array of artist and musical influences in a live acoustic setting. The main purpose of the Current Sessions is to highlight great independent music, while simultaneously showcasing Canadaâ€™s majestic waterways.
